# UCSC-Class-Tracker
The UCSC Course Availability Tracker is a web-based application that monitors enrollment in UCSC courses and notifies students when a spot opens up in their desired classes. Students can add courses to their watch list, and the system will automatically check for openings at regular intervals. When a seat becomes available, the system sends a real-time notification via email or text message, ensuring that students can register as soon as possible.

Key Features:
- Automated Course Monitoring: Tracks UCSC course enrollment status in real-time.
- Custom Watch List: Students can add and manage courses they want to enroll in.
- Instant Notifications: Sends alerts via email or text when a seat opens up.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive dashboard to manage watch-listed courses.
- Integration with UCSC Course System: Ensures accurate and up-to-date enrollment data.

This tool helps students secure spots in high-demand classes by eliminating the need for manual course availability checks.
